    <header><h2>The transition into greatness was approached</h2></header>
        <p>We must teach about the great warriors of the past. I want to tell you about a princess from Tokyo, Japan who was known as one of the most heroic female Shinja, Himiko-Isamu, who was powerful and a grand master of her kingdom‚Äôs army. Her presence was terrific, she led the kingdom‚Äôs army to several battles and recorded victory. This made everyone in the kingdom admire Himiko-Isamu the female shinja. She‚Äôs the dream wife of every young man in the Tsuki kingdom.</p>
    <h2>The Battle</h2>
        <p>One day, there was a battle between the kunoichix clan where the princess belonged, and the Shinobi clan. The Shinobi clan, because they were wealthy, manipulated the hearts of the kings of the other kingdoms to help them wage a war against the kunoichix clan.

            The great war that‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúWar of eye üëÅÔ∏è for eye üëÅÔ∏è ‚Äú was fought in the valley of Fakamina, after 100 days of fierce battles, the clan defeated the Shinobi clan by beheading Kitana their leader.
            
            However, as a result of the war, a famine occurred in the kunoichix kingdom, Himiko-Isamu was worried and she kept thinking of a way out.</p>
    <h2>GrandFather Ryoshi</h2>
        <p>She remembered the words of her grandfather Ryoshi, the god of wisdom and wealth, and she began to engage in deep meditation.

            One day, while she was meditating and looking for answers Ryoshi appeared to her and he took her into the future. He imparted to her wisdom on how to use decentralized finance to solve the famine problem in the kunoichix kingdom.
            
            The token that will be used to solve the famine problem would be the $Himiko token.</p>
